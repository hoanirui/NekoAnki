# NekoAnki -- Gamefying Spaced Repetition Software on Android 

Hi, thanks for trying out Neko-Anki! I hope this will improve your flashcard learning experience while gathering cute cats :) 

*********

# Basic Idea
The main idea is to collect cats while enjoying the flashcard learning process.
You can buy and place food on a plate to attract a variety of cats in the Easter Egg game. Each food item has a different cost and different probability of getting a new cat.
If you click a full plate, the food will turn back to coins, i.e. you will get a refund for the food.

Once a new cat (or an old one) arrives, you can look it up in the cat menu and rename it with a simple tap. If you want to boast about your cat collection, a long-press allows you to share your cats.

When your coins are insufficient, NekoAnki is there to provide coins through learning.
Also, you can directly access NekoAnki to earn coins when you feel like studying. However, please click “Earn Coins” at least once in the game at the beginning, to synchronise the game and NekoAnki. Note that an Internet connection is required to earn coins.

# Requirement and Set-up Instructions
Available on Android P and O.
Please use the two APKs provided to install both applications.

# For the game
After installing the APKs, please scroll down the Quick Setting menu twice and click the edit symbol for the settings.
From there, scroll all the way down and you will find a cat labeled "????" at the bottom.
Long press this tile and drag it up to the Quick Setting area.
Back in the Quick Setting menu, a new icon will show up as "Empty dish".
You can give it a tap to choose and place food. Now, just wait for new cats to come.
Please see also relevant videos for visual instructions.

# Connecting the two apps
To connect the two apps, you need to click the “Earn Coins” option in the Quick Setting menu once. Once initialized, coins may be earned directly through studying flashcards in the NekoAnki software. Note that an Internet connection is required to earn coins.
